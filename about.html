                    <p class="explainer-section-sub">A collection of quarterly zines, filled with hand drawn interviews and observations centered around 1 thought-provoking question each season.</p>

                    <p class="about-text">4 Questions to Make You Think is a zine that presses harder on some of the big, intimate questions that matter to us and that open new avenues of discussion between reader and speaker.</p>
        
                    <p class="about-text">Each issue will be sent out individually throughout the year as they are published. Interviews and illustrations will focus on the season's chosen question, and will be created for each issue in the months before publication. Interviewees can be anyone, from people randomly walking by, to strangers from the Internet, to you! By the end of the year, we'll have collected dozens of unique stories that will hopefully open us up to new perspectives on questions that are both personal and universal.</p>

                    <p class="about-text">I’m a designer and illustrator who loves to sketch and learn about other people! I run an online interview series on biotechnology, design for all kinds of personal and client projects, and write about my experiences as a product designer. I love beautiful printed things, and the zine community has been a huge inspiration. Zine culture is all about sharing and creating without boundaries—there are no rules of any sort for what content should go in a zine, no predefined formats or restrictions.</p>

                    <p class="about-text">4 Questions to Make You Think is supported by a community of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/46954895/4-questions-to-make-you-think-a-hand-drawn-quarter" target="_blank">wonderful Kickstarter backers</a>. If you have questions or want to talk about the project, feel free to <a href="mailto:4questionszine@gmail.com" target="_top">drop me a line</a>. 4 Questions is an experiment in sharing stories—and I would love to hear yours!</p>
